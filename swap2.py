# Wap to Swap 2 Numbers without using Thired/Temp Variable

# Hardcoding: whenevr you give direct values to your variables
#             this process is called Hardcoding

# logic based Question


A = 20

B = 45

print("Before Swap Value of A is = ", A)
print("Before Swap Value of B is = ", B)

# logic For Swap 2 Values Without Temp 

A = A + B    # A = 20+45 => A = 65

B = A - B    # B = 65-45 => B = 20

A = A - B    # A = 65-20 => A = 45


print("After Swap Value of A is = ", A)
print("After Swap Value of B is = ", B)



C = 80

D = 75

print("Before Swap Value of C is = ", C)
print("Before Swap Value of D is = ", D)

C , D = 75 , 80


print("After Swap Value of C is = ", C)
print("After Swap Value of D is = ", D)
